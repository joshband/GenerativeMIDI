# 2. Then run:
sudo xcode-select --switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer
sudo xcodebuild -license accept
```

### Build the iOS App

```bash
cd /Users/noisebox/Repos/GenerativeMIDI
./build_ios.sh
open build_ios/GenerativeMIDI.xcodeproj
```

In Xcode:
1. Select **GenerativeMIDI_AUv3** scheme (top left)
2. Click on project name in left sidebar
3. Select **GenerativeMIDI_AUv3** target
4. Go to **Signing & Capabilities** tab
5. Check "Automatically manage signing"
6. Select your **Team** (your Apple ID)
7. Connect your iPad/iPhone via USB
8. Select your device from device dropdown (top)
9. Press ‚åòR (or click Play button)

The app will build and install directly to your device!
