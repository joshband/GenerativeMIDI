## üé® Animation Timing

### Steampunk Timing Guidelines

**Mechanical Movement (Knobs, Sliders):**
- Rotation/Slide: 150-300ms
- Easing: Cubic-bezier(0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 1) - mechanical smoothness
- Overshoot: None (precise mechanical)
- Steam Burst: Triggered at end of movement

**Steam Effects:**
- Rise Speed: 50-100px/second
- Fade Duration: 2-4 seconds
- Turbulence: Perlin noise, subtle
- Spawn Delay: 50-200ms between particles

**Glow Pulse (Idle):**
- Duration: 2-3 seconds per cycle
- Intensity: 60% ‚Üí 80% ‚Üí 60%
- Easing: Sine wave (smooth breathing)

**Electrical Spark:**
- Flash On: Instant (0ms)
- Hold: 50-100ms
- Fade Out: 100-200ms
- Easing: Linear fade

**Data Flow:**
- Travel Time: 500-1000ms per path
- Particle Speed: Constant
- Spawn Interval: 100-300ms between particles

**Design Philosophy:**
*"Every control is a precision instrument from a Victorian inventor's workshop. Brass speaks of craftsmanship, steam carries energy, and aether flows through circuits inscribed with sacred geometry."*
